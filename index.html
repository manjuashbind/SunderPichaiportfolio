                        I worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company. I joined Google in 2004, where I led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. I went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.
